\section {The algorithms of Kruskal and Prim}

Both \textbf{Kruskal} and \textbf{Prim} use a specific rule to \textbf{determine
  a safe edge} in line 3 of GENERIC-MST.

In Kruskal's algorithm, the set \textbf{A} is a forest whose vertices are all
those of the given graph. The safe edge added to \textbf{A} is always a
\textbf{least-weight} edge in the graph that \textbf{connects two distinct
  components}.

In Prim's algorithm, the set \textbf{A} forms a single tree. The safe edge added
to \textbf{A} is always a \textbf{least-weight edge connecting the tree to a
  vertex not in the tree}.
