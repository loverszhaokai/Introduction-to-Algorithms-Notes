The **(binary) heap** data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly **complete binary** tree (see Section B.5.3), as shown in Figure 6.1. Each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. The tree is completely filled on all levels except possibly the lowest, which is filled from the left up to a point. An array A that represents a heap is an object with two attributes: **A.length**, which (as usual) gives the number of elements in the array, and **A.heap-size**, which represents how many elements in the heap are stored within array A. That is, although A[ 1 .. A.length ] may contain numbers, only the elements in A[ 1 .. heap-size ], where 0 <=􏰃**A.heap-size** <= **A.length**, are valid elements of the heap. The root of the tree is A[1], and given the index i of a node, we can easily compute the indices of its parent, left child, and right child:

**Figure 6.1** A max-heap viewed as (a) a binary tree and (b) an array. The number within the circle at each node in the tree is the value stored at that node. The number above a node is the corresponding index in the array. Above and below the array are lines showing parent-child relationships; parents are always to the left of their children. The tree has height three; the node at index 4 (with value 8) has height one.

PARENT(i)

1 return ⎣ i / 2 ⎦

LEFT(i)

1 return 2i

RIGHT(i)

1 return 2i + 1
