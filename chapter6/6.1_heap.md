The (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree (see Section B.5.3), as shown in Figure 6.1. Each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. The tree is com- pletely filled on all levels except possibly the lowest, which is filled from the left up to a point. An array A that represents a heap is an object with two at- tributes: A:length, which (as usual) gives the number of elements in the array, and A:heap-size, which represents how many elements in the heap are stored within array A. That is, although AŒ1 : : A: length􏰇 may contain numbers, only the ele- ments in AŒ1::A:heap-size􏰇, where 0 􏰃 A:heap-size 􏰃 A:length, are valid ele- ments of the heap. The root of the tree is AŒ1􏰇, and given the index i of a node, we can easily compute the indices of its parent, left child, and right child:
