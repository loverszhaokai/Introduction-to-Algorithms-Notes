\textbf { \color {red} Exercies }

\subsection {Give a real-world example that requires sorting or
a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.}

\textbf{Answer}: One example that requires sorting is that teachers will sort our
scores after the exam.

\subsection {Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency
might one use in a real-world setting ?}

\textbf{Answer}: cost, space, manpower, material resources. In different cases,
each can be the key of meausres of efficiency.

\subsection {Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss
its strengths and limitations.}

\textbf{Answer}: Array

strengths: access directly

limitations: costs lot when insert or delete

\subsection {How are the {\color{blue}shortest-path} and {\color{blue}traveling-salesman}
problems given {\color{blue}similar}? How they are {\color{blue}different}?}

\subsection {Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution
will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best
is good enough.}
