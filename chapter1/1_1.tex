1.1-1 Give a real-world example that requires sorting or
a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Answer}: One example that requires sorting is that teachers will sort our
scores after the exam.

1.1-2 Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency
might one use in a real-world setting ?

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Answer}: cost, space, manpower, material resources. In different cases,
each can be the key of meausres of efficiency.

1.1-3 Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss
its strengths and limitations.

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Answer}: Array

strengths: access directly

limitations: costs lot when insert or delete

1.1-4 How are the {\color{blue}shortest-path} and {\color{blue}traveling-salesman}
problems given {\color{blue}similar}? How they are {\color{blue}different}?

1.1-5 Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution
will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best
is good enough.
